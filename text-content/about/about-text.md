## About Droplet Escrow

💱 Droplet is an experiment for distributing payments in a fast, secure and transparent way.

💵 Build your own minimum viable escrow agreements on the ethereum blockchain.



💸 We use Droplet to distribute payments to employees or partners in different time-periods.

💎 Every member of the agreement can withdraw his fair share and pause the contract if necessary.
